    <h2>About My Career</h2>
    <p>
        I started my computer science journey with a beginner course at Cerritos College, where I quickly became fascinated by the intricacies of code and the power of programming. From the first project, my mind was buzzing with ideas of building efficient systems that could solve real-world problems. Within a year, I had completed foundational courses and secured an entry-level position as a student ambassador, helping others discover their own paths in the field. This role allowed me to develop essential skills in communication and teamwork, but I knew I wanted to work hands-on with more complex systems.
